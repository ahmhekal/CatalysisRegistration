						<h2>who we are ? </h2>
                        <p>We are: Catalysis, the first student activity to originate from the ‘Credit Hours Engineering Programs – CHEP’ at Ain Shams University. When it first started at 2009.It aimed to provide, as a student-held organization, financial and academic support to Ain Shams Engineering students with exceptional ideas for practical science and engineering projects to execute these projects.Catalysis' role was then developed to give the chance for students to apply the knowledge they gain throughout their studies in state of the art, science & engineering projects, which were provided in the form of Academic Committee workshops Then our principles expanded in 2011, at the end of 2010 with the merge of the student activity “BIG” with Catalysis (under Catalysis name), thus the Awareness Committee was introduced into the structure of Catalysis. It aimed at developing an awareness renaissance for all engineering students to become more functional members in our Egyptian society.</p>

						<h2>Catalysis science fistival</h2>
                        <p>The CSF is an event organized by Catalysis to prove that science is fun and YOU can apply it by yourself through explaining complicated principles and theories by using fun and easy scientific experiments.</p>
						<h2>work shops</h2>
						<p>Since we're concerned with raising scientific awareness, we believe that applying our ideas is the shortest way, so each year Catalysis is concerned with carrying out workshops aiming to develop students' technical skills through implementing their ideas into projects. </p>

						<h2>Academic Track</h2>
                        <p>An extracurricular chance to try and apply science & engineering through the Academic Committee practical projects that would develop engineering students scientifically by working on projects and researches on various topics, as well as develop the research base at Ain Shams university.</p>
						<h2>Awareness Track</h2>
						<p>Aims at creating an awareness renaissance, by raising the awareness levels for engineering students who will lead our next Egyptian renaissance. This is achieved through reviving lost morals and values. It was active till 2013 and then starting from 2014 we decided to turn the awareness into an internal track to focus on our members so that everyone of them could make a difference in his own way. </p>

						<h2>Contact</h2>
                        <p>You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft encounters a black hole does the computer call it an 'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never told anyone it means we never made it back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic.</p>
						<h3>Get in touch</h3>
						<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>
